Our vision is to help our peers with donations these may be stationary, money and clothing. We have created a website that will help people make donations. Our program is there to offer help to students in need and in future we aim to help as many people as possible as our organisation continues to grow.
 We have to bring up new generation of healthy, educated and inspired beings for our future.

Our vision and mission are to help as many people as we can. As of now we’re helping our fellow peers at Cape Peninsula University of Technology with basic needs. By 2024 our organization will have expanded enough to be able to assist starving children in South Africa as research shows the amount of malnourished and starving children has increased exponentially during the pandemic. 
“Our kids are in a terrible state Malnutrition is slow violence and stunted children are unable to learn” - CRC founder Marcus Solomon.
